- 👋 Hi, I’m @guminsfection - Picked this name because I currently have a gum infection :)
- 👀 I’m interested in building projects, any types of prejects. Coding is one of my hobbies I just got into it I am still learning, but i find it to be really fun.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning javascript, I was learning python, but just seemed too easy I like to challenge my self and learn new skills. As my skills grow I also
want to learn C++.
- 💞️ I’m looking to find friends with the same hobbie as me.
